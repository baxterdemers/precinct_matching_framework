This project is intended to help speed up to process of matching similar precinct names (e.g. `LEHIGH TWP DIST PENNSVILLE` to `LEHIGH District PENN`) in a way that is self-documenting and easy to reproduce. 

Goals:

1. Improve iteration speed of County Matches
2. Isolate changes to a particluar county while making it ## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Northumberland County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Wayne County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Elk County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Indiana County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Armstrong County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Cameron County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Juniata County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = McKean County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Philadelphia County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Perry County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Beaver County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Crawford County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Butler County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Greene County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Lancaster County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Northampton County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Monroe County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Fayette County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Dauphin County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Lycoming County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Warren County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Snyder County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Chester County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Clinton County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Mercer County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Franklin County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Fulton County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Potter County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Montour County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Adams County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Lawrence County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Blair County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Luzerne County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Clarion County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Washington County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Lehigh County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Allegheny County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Tioga County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Westmoreland County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Pike County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Susquehanna County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Bedford County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Cumberland County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Erie County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Berks County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Jefferson County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Wyoming County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Carbon County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Bradford County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Bucks County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Delaware County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Columbia County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Somerset County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Montgomery County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = York County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Schuylkill County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Lackawanna County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Centre County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Lebanon County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Clearfield County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Sullivan County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Venango County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Union County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Forest County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Cambria County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Huntingdon County## Documentation for matching in `county_id` = Mifflin County
